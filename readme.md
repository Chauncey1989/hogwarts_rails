# OH NO

Hogwarts has lost all its magic and now NOTHING WORKS!

## First
You are part of Dumbledore's Army. Correct all the errors so that this app runs properly.

## Then
- Add functionality so students can enroll at Hogwarts (creating a new student).
- Implement a "Sorting Hat" method to randomly assign new students to one of Hogwarts' four houses. (Where do you think this logic should go?)
